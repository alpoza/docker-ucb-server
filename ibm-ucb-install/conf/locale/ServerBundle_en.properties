PostProcessingScriptsSystemHelpBox=Use this section to create and edit post-processing scripts. These scripts are used in job steps to determine the success or failure of a step based on the exit code and log from that step. A typical script might check for a non-zero exit code and declare failure; or it might look for the string 'Build Success' in the step output and mark the step as a success.
PostProcessScriptDesc=Specify the post processing script to be run here. The script must be written in JavaScript<br/> You will have access to the output properties from the step in a java.util.Properties variable named <b>properties</b>. <br>The properties will have a special property for the exit code of the process called <b>exitCode</b>.<br/>It will also have a special property for the final status called <b>Status</b>. A status of <b>Success</b> is the only status that wont result in the step failing. <br/>There will also be a variable called <b>scanner</b> which can be used to scan the output log of the step. It has these public methods\: <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;register(String regex, function call) -> this will register a new function to be called whenever the regex is matched. <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; addLOI(Integer lineNumber) -> this will add a specific line to the lines of interest list. These will be highlighted in the LogViewer after the process has finished. This is implicitly called anytime the scanner matches a line. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;getLinesOfInterest() -> this will return a java.util.List<Integer> that is the list of lines of interest. This can be used for removing lines when necessary.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scan() -> this tells the scanner to go ahead and scan the log. Should be invoked after all regexs are registered.

Schedule=Schedule
ScheduleAllowedSpecialCharacters=Allowed Special Characters
ScheduleBuildInterval=build interval (minutes)
ScheduleBuildIntervalDesc=The amount of minutes that will pass before the scheduled task gets run.
ScheduleBuildIntervalWithColon=Build Interval (minutes)\:
ScheduleConfigureSystemHelpBox=Configure the Schedule Type in this section. Once a Schedule Type is selected, additional properties specific to that Schedule Type will be displayed.
ScheduleCronCharHelp1=is used to specify all values. For example, "*" in the minute field means "every minute".
ScheduleCronCharHelp10=is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields. This character is short-hand for "calendar". This means values are calculated against the associated calendar, if any. If no calendar is associated, then it is equivalent to having an all-inclusive calendar. A value of "5C" in the day-of-month field means "the first day included by the calendar on or after the 5th". A value of "1C" in the day-of-week field means "the first day included by the calendar on or after sunday".<br/> <i>( cron Expression description from http\://quartz.sourceforge.net )</i>
ScheduleCronCharHelp2=is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields. It is used to specify 'no specific value'. This is useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields, but not the other. See the examples below for clarification.
ScheduleCronCharHelp3=is used to specify ranges For example "10-12" in the hour field means "the hours 10, 11 and 12".
ScheduleCronCharHelp4=is used to specify additional values. For example "MON,WED,FRI" in the day-of-week field means "the days Monday, Wednesday, and Friday".
ScheduleCronCharHelp5=is used to specify increments. For example "0/15" in the seconds field means "the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45". And "5/15" in the seconds field means "the seconds 5, 20, 35, and 50". You can also specify '/' after the '*' character - in this case '*' is equivalent to having '0' before the '/'.
ScheduleCronCharHelp6=is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields. This character is short-hand for "last", but it has different meaning in each of the two fields. For example, the value "L" in the day-of-month field means "the last day of the month" - day 31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used in the day-of-week field by itself, it simply means "7" or "SAT". But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it means "the last xxx day of the month" - for example "6L" means "the last friday of the month". When using the 'L' option, it is important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you'll get confusing results.
ScheduleCronCharHelp7=is allowed for the day-of-month field.  This character is used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day.  As an example, if you were to specify "15W" as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is\: "the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month".  So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Friday the 14th.  If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 16th.  If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on Tuesday the 15th.  However if you specify "1W" as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not 'jump' over the boundary of a month's days.  The 'W' character can only be specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.
ScheduleCronCharHelp8=can also be combined for the day-of-month expression to yield 'LW', which translates to "last weekday of the month".
ScheduleCronCharHelp9=is allowed for the day-of-week field. This character is used to specify "the nth" XXX day of the month. For example, the value of "6\#3" in the day-of-week field means the third Friday of the month (day 6 \= Friday and "\#3" \= the 3rd one in the month). Other examples\: "2\#1" \= the first Monday of the month and "4\#5" \= the fifth Wednesday of the month. Note that if you specify "\#5" and there is not 5 of the given day-of-week in the month, then no firing will occur that month.

ScheduleCronExample1=Fire at 5\:15pm every day
